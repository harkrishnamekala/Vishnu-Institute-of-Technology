    <h1>Rules for the Contest</h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>

    <p>I bet most of us have dreamt of racing our cars at top speeds through spick,
      black race courses. Come February and vishnu,
      Bhimavaram will be all set to fulfil your dream,
      well, in a way. On the line of the ecstatic Moto GP competition,
      we are conducting The RC car competition.
      The competition will have its participants (or racers) drive self-designed remote controlled cars
      through deliciously twisty race tracks to win the final cup! Seems simple? Well,
      brace yourselves for some rock solid competition.
      Forget not, the more innovative and inventive your design is,
      the closer you are to the Mini GP cup. Fasten your seat belts and let the adrenaline pump up!</p>

      <h2>Abstract:</h2>

        </p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The participants are required to send the photographs of the chassis before assembling so as to ensure that the parts of the car have been built by themselves.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>The participants are expected to race their remote control based IC engine cars through tracks
        whose complexity is bound to increase level after level.
        The teams completing the laps in the best possible time will qualify for a grans final
        race. The design skills and application of real-world driving skills to the miniature cars
        are put to test.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>MACHINE SPECIFICATIONS:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The vehicle should be designed so that it fits in an 800 mm X 700 mm box at every given point of time in the race. This is excluding the remote controller.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The wheel base should not be less than 350 mm.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It is essential that the car be designed with an Internal Combustion Engine (IC Engine). Any other engines and BLDC Motors etc. should not be the main driving sources of the car. However, for steering mechanisms or any other mechanism apart from propulsion, DC motors and servos can be used.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Only one IC engine should be used in the vehicle. Use of any other sources such as chemicals, compressed gas, rockets, etc. for propulsion are not allowed. The allowed capacity of IC engine to be used is 4.5 cc or less.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The vehicle has to be necessarily controlled by a wireless remote control system throughout the competition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Remote control systems from toys or the ones purchased from a market might be used without any fear of penalization.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The vehicle parts can be readymade. But, there will be extra points if you make chassis and steering mechanism by yourself.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you make your car, other functional parts like motors and servos, gears, springs, engine, remote control systems, batteries, wheels, braking mechanism are allowed to be used as directly available from the market.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              All vehicles should have a complete body covering all internal mechanisms of the vehicle.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Readymade covers are allowed or can be designed and manufactured by the team out of any suitable material.
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The tracks will be built according to an 1:8 size car.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A control stand will be provided along the track for the driver to position himself to control his vehicle during the run. The height of the stand will be around 8 feet. The controlling of machine has to be done from this stand only.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
          3-5 cars will be racing on the tracks at the same time and try to surpass the opponentâ€™s car while maintaining its stability.
        </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>
             If the organizers are convinced that a team is trying to harm the opponentâ€™s car, the respective team will be disqualified.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>
             A lap of the track is completed when the car comes back to the finish point.

         <li>
           <p>
             If a vehicle becomes immobilized during the course of a race, the corresponding team will have to forfeit that particular round.

         </li>
         <li>
           <p>
             Checkpoints will be arranged throughout the track. In case of a human intervention during the course of a race, the car will have to restart the race from the previous checkpoint.
